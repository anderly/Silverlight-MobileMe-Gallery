# Silverlight MobileMe Gallery

The **Silverlight MobileMe Gallery** is a recreation of the Apple MobileMe Gallery using 100% pure Silverlight.  

## UPDATE

* This project is no longer under active development. I did this as a learning excercise to learn Silverlight and try to recreate something useful and elegant. If you would like it to continue, please contact me or grab the code and fork away!

## Getting Started

 - Last Release: v0.1 Alpha 11/25/2009
 - Check out the Apple MobileMeGallery sample (this is what we're trying to recreate): http://gallery.me.com/emily_parker
 - Visit the working sample (using Silverlight) here: http://gallery.restazured.com/emily_parker
   - **Note**: You can also try your own MobileMe username using format: http://gallery.restazured.com/[your username here]

## About the Silverlight MobileMe Gallery

The goal in one sentence is to create an exact replica, feature-for-feature match of the MobileMe Gallery using 100% Silverlight.  
This project began as a way to experiment with and learn the new features in Silverlight 3. Check out the blog post that introduced the idea:  [ Recreating the MobileMe Gallery in Silverlight 3][1]

In addition to learning the features in Silverlight 3, I also wanted to experiment with using Expression Blend 3 as a compliment to Silverlight development. Therefore, all graphics (rss button, image slider, etc) and toolbar items were created/styled using Expression Blend 3.

## Key Features & Success Criteria:

* Play MPEG-4 (.m4v) files using Silverlight without the need for QuickTime 
* Photo Album and Movie "Scrubbing" (if you view the sample above, you'll see what I mean when you mouse over an album or movie)
* Full featured photo album with all the features (and views) of the one built-in to MobileMe Gallery
* Utilize the photos/movies already stored on MobileMe Gallery (no separate upload or storage mechanism required)
* Support same URL structure as MobileMe: http://gallery.me.com/[**username]**
    * Work with **ANY** MobileMe username: http://gallery.restazured.com/[**username]**
* **100% Silverlight implementation**
